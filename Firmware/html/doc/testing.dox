@page testing Testing Firmware

Testing is a vast field and there are lots of different approaches.
In the context of the Cable-Monitor, however,
testing the different modules is straightforward.
A final combined test shows if the modules work together as expected.

Even if only simple and quite obvious tests have been done,
it is nonetheless important to document them.

@todo Define, run, document and evaluate all the important tests.
